## About Me
Hi! My name is Elizabeth Spratt. Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at UNCG. 
I enjoy learning new technologies and working on collaborative projects. I have two dogs as well! Last semester I did take this class but was going through a loss in my family so I'm sort of familar with the topics. 

## My CSC340 Goals
In CSC340, I want to strengthen my skills in teamwork, version control (Git/GitHub). I want to create a project that I am very confident with.
